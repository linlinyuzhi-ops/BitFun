 * Where the transport writes its breadcrumbs, mirroring `RemoteLogger.ets`.

 * Shared code cannot reach hilog / Logcat / OSLog, so the app supplies the sink.
 * The redaction discipline stays here rather than at the sink: every call site
 * in this module passes ids through [shortRoomId] / [shortRequestId] first, so
 * a full room id, token or key cannot reach an implementation of this interface
 * even if the app logs everything it is handed.
