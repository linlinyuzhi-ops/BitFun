 * detail of either screen.
 *
 * The relay's device record carries a name and a presence flag and no kind, so
 * "is this a desktop" has to be answered from the name. That answer is exact for
 * the clients we ship — a HarmonyOS phone registers under a fixed name — and
 * absent for the ones we do not: an Android phone registers under `Build.MODEL`,
 * so a *second* Android install shows up here looking like a desktop. Only the
 * relay can close that gap by reporting a kind; until it does, this is the same
 * list HarmonyOS shows, which is the point.
