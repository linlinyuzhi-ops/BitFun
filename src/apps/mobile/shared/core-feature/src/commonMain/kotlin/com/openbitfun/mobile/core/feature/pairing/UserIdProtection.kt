/**
 * The consecutive-failure cooldown on pairing credentials.
 *
 * Ports the `MAX_FAILED_USER_ID_ATTEMPTS` / `USER_ID_LOCKOUT_MS` half of
 * `ConnectionErrorPolicy` together with `MobileIdentityStore.saveUserIdProtection`.
 * A desktop that protects its user id is the thing being guarded here: without a
 * cooldown, a device that can reach the relay can try user ids as fast as it can
 * send requests.
 *
 * **It is persisted, and that is the whole point.** A counter that lives only in
 * memory is defeated by force-quitting the app between attempts, which is not a
 * defence at all. [SecureStore] is the store because it is the one that is not a
 * plaintext preference a rooted shell can reset with a single `am` command —
 * this is state about a defence, not a secret, but it deserves the same tamper
 * resistance.
 *
 * An expired lock clears the count as well, so this is a cooldown rather than a
 * ratchet: waiting it out gives the *user* their attempts back too, and a
 * permanent lock on a device that has no other way in would be worse than the
 * attack it prevents.
