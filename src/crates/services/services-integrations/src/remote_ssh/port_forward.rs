//! Local (`ssh -L`) port forwarding over an established SSH session.
//!
//! A forward is a listener on this machine whose accepted connections are
//! spliced onto a `direct-tcpip` channel, so the remote sshd dials the service
//! and the two streams are copied in both directions.
//!
//! Two properties drive the design:
//!
//! - **The remote endpoint is the identity, the local port is an allocation.**
//!   Users care that "the dev server on the remote's port 3000 is reachable
//!   from here"; which local port carries it is a detail. Binding therefore
//!   falls back to an arbitrary free port instead of failing, and reports what
//!   was asked for so the UI can explain the move.
//! - **A forward must never resurrect a session the user closed.** Channels are
//!   opened through [`SSHConnectionManager`] on every connection rather than
//!   against a cached handle, which is what keeps a forward working across an
//!   automatic reconnect; the liveness check before each open is what stops
//!   that same path from silently dialing back out after an explicit
//!   disconnect.
