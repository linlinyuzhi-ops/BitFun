# DeepSeek Harness (dsh) Adapter

This crate owns the static, runtime-free projection of DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`)
plugin package sources. It reads a OpenBitFun-managed package whose
`openbitfun.plugin.json` declares `adapter: "dsh_compatible"`, parses the package's
`package.json` `dsh` declaration, and projects the discovered bundle entries
(`dsh.bundle.patch` -> `cordis.patch.yml` rows) and/or profile bundle references
(`dsh.profile.bundles`) as projection-only plugin sources.

It does not execute Cordis plugins, install npm packages, or depend on a
user-local `dsh` CLI. Execution of dsh bundles belongs to future Plugin Host /
external-ACP work, not this adapter boundary.

If executable dsh support is added, the dsh adapter may project capabilities
whose OpenBitFun owner semantics have been verified through the provider-neutral
plugin capability contract. Cordis source parsing, execution handles, Host
protocol, and lifecycle remain dsh-owned and must not reuse the OpenCode Config
Hook or OpenCode Plugin Host composition path. The current configured Skill-root
merge and precedence behavior remains OpenCode-owned; dsh Skill publication
requires its own consumer evidence before that path is shared.

## Boundary Rules

- Depend on stable contracts (`openbitfun-runtime-ports`, `openbitfun-product-domains`)
  and the `PluginRuntimeAdapter` boundary trait. Do not depend on `openbitfun-core`,
  app crates, Tauri APIs, product UI, or concrete service managers.
- Keep the dsh `package.json` `dsh` field shape and `cordis.patch.yml` entry
  extraction inside this crate. Cross-crate outputs use typed
  `PluginSourceRef` / `PluginStatusSnapshot` / `PluginDiagnostic` DTOs; do not
  expose raw dsh YAML or JSON as product contracts.
- Cordis rows may mount services that register model-facing tools when dsh runs
  them, but static row metadata is not an executable OpenBitFun provider candidate.
  `load_dsh_package_adapter` therefore returns no provider dispatch targets.
  Unsupported or unparsable content must produce typed invalid projections and
  diagnostics, never silent success.
- New ecosystems are sibling adapters registered by Product Assembly
  (`openbitfun-core/plugin_runtime`), not modes of this adapter.

## Verification

- `cargo test --locked -p openbitfun-dsh-adapter --test dsh_source_adapter`
- `cargo test --locked -p openbitfun-core --no-default-features --features plugin-runtime --lib plugin_runtime::tests`
