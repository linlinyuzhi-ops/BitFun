# FlowChat Virtualization

## Embedded session lifetime

`BtwSessionPanel` keeps a lightweight tab-owned wrapper while its content is
inactive. Its transcript and observers unmount immediately. `BtwVirtualSessionList`
shares the virtualizer and stable row keys; `useBtwPanelViewport` saves a visible
row key and intra-row offset while reading, then restores against estimated and
mounted geometry. Readers following output return to the live tail. The shared
`useExploreGroupState` accepts initial expansion state for this remount boundary;
the primary transcript retains its existing default and session lifetime.

## Result visibility and read receipts

`useSessionCompletionReceipt` reads the final projected non-user item for the
unread Turn through `sessionToVirtualItems` and `getVirtualItemStableKey`. Its
cache is keyed by Session object and device surface, so unrelated stream/store
updates do not re-project the transcript. It observes only while a settled result
is unread, and checks the real result end against the visible scroller rectangle
in a focused, foreground document. A mounted overscan row, an inactive scene, or
an older result beneath a newer summary cannot acknowledge completion. This hook
performs no viewport writes and introduces no reservation or follow-output logic.
The same receipt applies to the Btw viewport; opening either view alone is not a
receipt. Native visual and focus/scroll acceptance remains a manual check.

What the virtualization library is allowed to decide, what stays ours, and the
one rule about rendering that only makes sense once a row's lifetime is shorter
than its content's.

## What Belongs to the Virtualizer

FlowChat virtualizes with **TanStack Virtual**, behind `useFlowChatVirtualizer.ts`.
Nothing else imports it. The rest of FlowChat asks for offsets in scroller
coordinates and gets them back; there is no index space of the virtualizer's own
to convert at the edges, because measurements are cached against **item keys**,
so a history prepend leaves every measured item exactly where it was.

That is only half of what react-virtuoso's `firstItemIndex` did, and the other
half has to be supplied — see *Keeping the Viewport on the Reader's Content* in
`FLOWCHAT_HISTORY_PAGING.md`.

The reason it is TanStack and not react-virtuoso is one line of its measurement
pass: `size = measured ?? estimateSize(i)`. A per-item estimate for everything
unmeasured. react-virtuoso reserves a single scalar (`lastSize`) for all of
them, and this transcript alternates 38px user messages with model rounds up to
5012px, so the scroll range was wrong by an order of magnitude until an item was
actually measured. `estimateVirtualMessageItemHeightWithContext` now feeds it
directly. The estimate is owned by the data shape in
`virtualItemHeightEstimators.ts`: text, thinking, user messages, model rounds,
Explore groups, and tool families each derive a bounded height from their
content, status, width, and expansion state. This code is pure and runs before
a row has a DOM node. Once mounted, DOM measurement remains authoritative and
replaces the estimate. Width and volatile Explore expansion changes invalidate
only the derived position pass; TanStack's key-based measured-size cache is
retained.

**Items stay in normal flow inside a padded window**, not absolutely positioned.
Everything outside the window stands in as `padding-top` and `padding-bottom`
(`virtualWindowPaddingPx`). This matters for more than tidiness: when an item
inside the window changes height, the browser reflows the ones below it in the
same layout pass, so there is no frame where the scroll has been corrected but
the items have not moved yet.

**The virtualizer does not use TanStack's own late-measurement adjustment.**
`shouldAdjustScrollPositionOnItemSizeChange` reads the real scroller position
and asks the viewport owner to apply the delta only when the whole item is above
the viewport. A partly visible row is left alone because its changed content is
inside what the reader is looking at. TanStack's adjustment is always refused:
it applies its delta to `scrollOffset`, the library's copy refreshed only from
scroll events. Every continuous writer here assigns `scrollTop` directly and
the matching scroll event lands a frame later, so that base can be stale. The
owner's displacement is applied before the new size enters the cache, while
the anchor remains responsible for restoring relationships across larger layout
transactions.

The measurement decision is recorded as the switch-gated, coalesced
`virtualizer.itemResize` probe: item identity, estimated and measured sizes,
the above-viewport decision, and the real scroll geometry before and after the
owner's displacement. It deliberately omits flow-item contents, which made the
temporary investigation probe too large for a lasting diagnostic trail.

**Measurement is forced before any position is read in the commit that changed
the items.** The library skips its inline resize while the reader is scrolling,
which is exactly when history arrives, so the cache holds reserved estimates
until the ResizeObserver delivers a frame later.
`virtualizer.measureRenderedItems()` does that reconciliation itself — the same
work, a frame earlier, free for any row whose height was already right. The
evidence and the numbers are in *A Displacement Is Not a Movement* in
`FLOWCHAT_HISTORY_PAGING.md`.

**Alignment is asked for, not computed, wherever it fits.** `scrollItemIntoView`
goes through the virtualizer so that its re-aim keeps chasing the item while the
measurements under it move; an offset computed once is already stale by then.
The gap above a top-aligned Turn is the virtualizer's `scrollPaddingStart`, for
the same reason. Only two places compute an offset by hand, and both do it
because the target is not an item: the end of *real content*, which is above the
resident tail spacer, and the end of a Turn.

Two things that look like they belong here do not:

- **Positions in `virtualItems`.** That array is FlowChat's own projection, so
  an index into it means the same thing under any virtualizer. `scrollToIndex`,
  `scrollToSearchMatch`, and `data-virtual-index` all carry one and are left
  alone.
- **When to page.** `historyBoundariesForVisibleRange` decides that a boundary
  is worth asking about, from where the reader stands and nothing else. Its
  thresholds are the ones that decide *where* a junction happens, which is why
  they are named and tested rather than inline.

**Visible is not rendered.** `getVisibleItemRange` intersects the rows with the
scroller box; the rendered window carries overscan, and a transcript short
enough to render whole reports the first *and* last item present wherever the
viewport stands. Feeding the rendered window to a rule that means "has the
reader arrived here" asks whether the item exists instead. Measured: a 21-item
transcript rendered rows 0..20 from index 0 no matter where the reader was, so
the head boundary read as reached forever. It has to be a callback rather than a
value, because a scroll moves the viewport across the window without changing
it.

react-virtuoso remains a dependency: the file tree (`VirtualFileTree.tsx`) still
uses it. Nothing under `flow_chat/` does.

## The Projection Is the Stable Thing

Stable virtual-item keys and projection identity are required. Do not split one
`ModelRound` into multiple virtual items, and do not reclassify projection from
a timer.

Search matches retain their concrete text source and occurrence, grouped once
by virtual-item index. Row containers receive no search background or outline.
`useFlowChatSearchPresentation` owns mounted text highlights and one passive
line overlay for the current occurrence: a neutral line tint with a short gutter
marker. The overlay uses the first painted text fragment in row-local coordinates,
so it follows outer scrolling without a viewport write. Resize, content changes,
and nested scrolling refresh its geometry; clipped or unmounted sources produce
no marker. Each row releases only its own CSS highlight ranges. Search states
change no row geometry, spacing, or mount animation. Navigation and expansion
remain in `VirtualMessageList`, separate from presentation.

`getVirtualItemStableKey` keys on type, Turn and content id — never on an index.
That is what lets a prepend renumber every row without React unmounting any of
them, and it is what the measurement cache is keyed on underneath.

Tool cards reflow naturally and dispatch only `tool-card-toggle` after an
expanded-state change, so the virtualizer can remeasure. There is no
pre-collapse intent event and no per-card compensation.

`SmoothHeightCollapse` starts its completion timer in the animation frame that
applies the target height. A delayed frame must not shorten the transition or
unmount closing content early. Reversing a toggle cancels both the frame and timer.

User-message text and both message-edit inputs use the same `flow-control`
font-size role as the composer and rendered replies, following the user's font
preference. User-message text also uses the reply's regular weight. Its
first-line box must use that same font size when deriving row geometry.

User-message timestamps and actions occupy a normal-flow meta row below the
bubble. Its full height, including the 28px action targets, belongs to the
measured message even when no valid timestamp is available. The timestamp and
actions remain visible at rest, without requiring hover or keyboard focus; the
timestamp stays at the row's leading edge while the actions stay at its trailing
edge. The shell's trailing margin remains the item gap; the next Turn may remove
that gap without removing space occupied by controls.

## A Row's Mount Is Not an Arrival

**No mount or enter animation may live inside `.virtual-item-wrapper`**, no
mount-triggered motion may change transcript geometry, and nothing may be keyed
on a state change a scroll can replay.

Outside a virtualized list an element's insertion means its content arrived, and
a fade or a slide says so honestly. Here insertion means the row entered the
rendered window. Paging up mounts the Turns the page brought, the rows the
junction's own correction scrolls past, and every row the reader scrolls back
over afterwards — each one replaying whatever its stylesheet attached to mount.
`--streaming` to `--complete` is the same mistake in a different key: it fires
when the typewriter finishes, which is not when the reader is looking.

The one that shipped was `.markdown-renderer`, from the shared component
library: `animation: fadeIn var(--openbitfun-motion-duration-base) ease-out`,
350ms from `opacity: 0`. Once the junction displacement was down to tens of
pixels that fade was the entire remaining complaint — most of the screen
dimming and coming back on every page up. `VirtualItemRenderer.scss` cancels it
for anything inside a row and leaves the library alone, where a markdown block
really is mounted once.

The rule is stated here because four correct local fixes could not reach it.
`ModelRoundItem.scss` and `UserMessageItem.scss` each refuse an enter animation
of their own, in comments that name this reason. `FlowTextBlock`'s typewriter
refuses to replay on mount, because a streaming block that scrolled out and
back would restart from an empty string and re-grow. `FlowTextBlock.scss`
cancels this very fade — but only under `.streaming`, so the one block still
being written was exempt and the whole of history was not. Each author saw the
defect, guarded their own file, and had no way to guard a component in another
package.

## Transcript row columns

Thinking, Explore, ambient tool summaries and the runtime-status footer use
`control.flowChat.rowIconSize` (14px) and `rowIconGap` (4px). The outer content
column owns its responsive inset. Borderless rows add no leading padding or
transparent border; text-only replies and expanded thinking begin at that same
body edge. A summary with an icon starts its label 18px later. Tool/arrow/status
layers keep their slot during state changes. Native SVG artwork may contain
internal whitespace; do not compensate for it with per-tool margins.

Thinking/Explore labels use secondary content directly and their icons use the
caption role, avoiding a second opacity multiplier. These layout rules do not
change virtual-item identity, measurement ownership or viewport writes.

## Transcript vertical rhythm

The shared item gap is 8px and the inline gap is 4px. Thinking, Explore and
retry disclosure headers share the ambient 22px minimum line box, growing with
text. Consecutive collapsed ambient tools remain continuous lines with no added
inter-item gap. The existing projection flag preserves that rule across virtual
model-round boundaries; expanded and prominent cards keep the ordinary 8px gap.

The item-rhythm mixin belongs to ModelRoundItem, retry-attempt contents,
Explore contents and the subagent projection. Leaves carry no outer margin.
Enclosed contents remove their last gap; model rounds retain it until the virtual
Turn boundary removes it. Expanded Task wrappers use the same parent-owned gap
as other items; their body owns its internal padding. Export wrappers and the
Lab sequence own their own gaps. Thinking/Explore content has an 8px top inset;
bounded Explore retains 8px bottom padding for its scroll fade. There is no
negative adjacent-region margin. The resident runtime slot stays 24px high and
continues to participate in the existing footer/reservation contract.
